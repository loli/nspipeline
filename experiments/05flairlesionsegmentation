Some remarks:
- Keep in mind, that the goal is actually not to find the lesion, but all white matter hyperintensities!
- Large lesions and WMI should be found, smaller ones are rather irrelevant.
- Skull and meninges should rather not be excluded.

! Morphological operations, except hole closing, switched off in apply_rdf.py !

1. FLAIR & intensity only performance
	@results: logs/eval.pre.flair.int.log
	Visual examination:
		Horrible. Lesion is encountered to some extend reliably, but there
		are huge amounts of false positives all over the brain matter and
		especially in the skull and meninges where missed by the skull strip.
	Conclusion:
	=> Like this not suitable at all for masking out the lesions during registration.

2. FLAIR & feature combination performance
	@results: logs/eval.pre.flair.int_lmg3_lh1111.log
	@results: logs/eval.pre.flair.int_[...]
	Visual examination:
		A92gKwq4

	Conclusion:
	=>

3. Best sampling size for best feature combo from (2)
	@results: logs/eval.pre.sampling.Xk.log
	Runtimes:
		
	Visual examination:

	Conclusion:
	=>

4. Add DW as additional sequence
	@results: logs/eval.pre.flair_dw.int_[...].log
	Visual examination:

	Conclusion:
	=>

5. Intensity normalization (with best of (1)-(4))
	Strategies:
		a) disable
		b) intensity normalization (Oskar)
		c) intensity normalization (Nils)
		e) simple percentile (0.5, 99.5) => [0, 1]

6. Enable bias correction on best result
	Does it increase the results?
	Keep the remarks on top of this file in mind!
	
7. Register to std-brain and check visually the results
	Should be good in ALL cases!
