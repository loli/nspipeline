Conclusions
###########
- Ground truth of case 22 invalid, remove the case.
- The tendency of the segmentation to keep distance from dark areas becomes a problem where
	a) the lesion reaches near the ventricle
	b) the lesion reaches near the brain border (strangely)
	c) there are haemorrhages present inside the ischemic stroke lesion
  => I must find a way to enable the classifier to differ between the good and bad cases.
- Large, inhomogeneous lesions seem to pose a problem, especially when they are additionally only slightly hyperintensive. This might be caused by a failure of the intensity standardization.
  => Perform standardization in standard space under exclusion of the previously segmented lesion areas.
  => Note that using intensity standardization zero-mean / unit-variance did not improve these cases.
- False positive segmentation in cerebellum in an area of only very slight hyperintensity. No idea what might have caused this.
  => After registration to std space, this might be possible to overcome due to the centerdistance feature. Otherwise, I might have to think of another feature.
- False positive segmentation in skull.
  => After registration to std space, this might be possible to overcome due to the centerdistance feature and the improved skull-stripping.
- Very small lesion seem to pose a real challenge. Maybe these would require a less strong sub-sampling?
  => No idea how to solve this.


Analysis
########
<Case>	<Results flair-only>
<Remarks>

05	0.370	32.120	10.904
large, inomogeneous and diffuse lesion; strong under-segmentation; might be caused by a fail of intenstity standardization

10	0.480	27.873	7.593
large, inomogeneous and diffuse lesion; additionally two haemorrhages, which the segmentation avoids; strong under-segmentation; ground truth potentially to big; hold too much distance to brain border

11	0.505	41.759	5.610
small, unconnected embolic parts which are missed; segmentation tries to stay away from ventricles; already before post-processing the embolic parts were missed

22	0.192	26.324	7.906
very small lesions with large, adjacent WML that got include in the segmentation
!!! Looking at the DW, one can see that the segmented WML is actually part of the lesion and wrongly not included in the ground truth !!!

23	0.488	95.868	13.875
small lesion; but main problem is false positive in cerebellum; a segmentation in std space might help to remove this due to centerdistance feature

37	0.000	62.795	40.789
very small lesion with very large amount of other WMLs; just a very difficult case

40	0.382	44.311	8.292
large, diffuse and only partially connected lesion; strong under-segmentation; might be caused by a fail of intenstity standardization

41	0.145	50.769	11.584
large, diffuse and only slightly hyperintense; strong under-segmentation; might be caused by a fail of intenstity standardization

42	0.466	64.157	11.959
lesion itself sufficiently found; larger false positive in upper skull

44	0.000	 inf	 inf
very small and only slightly hyperintense lesion; just very difficult

45	0.329	32.797	9.251
partially WML included; under-segmented
