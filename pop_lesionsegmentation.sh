## Changelog
# 2014-08-13 Adapted to cope with multiple sequence configurations and ground truth sets
# 2014-05-08 Adapted to the new, distributed calculation scheme.
# 2013-04-03 Added a morphological post-processing step (and removed again).
# 2013-03-25 Updated to new, variable version.
# 2013-11-25 Updated to use new script to distinguish between sequence space and std space features
# 2013-11-05 adapted to new brain mask location
# 2013-10-29 created
