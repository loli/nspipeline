# Steps to register the Image to STD space
####

1. Convert all original images from 00original to .nii (as SPM can not read .nii.gz and performs better with skull present)
2. Create inverse of all t2space preliminary lesion masks (required by SPM)
3. Run SPM Normalize Estimate
	- input is the original T2 image
	- mask is the inversed lesion mask
	- template is the shipped ICBM T2 template
	- smoothing parameter for image is 8
	- smoothing parameter for template is 0
	=> this creates a .mat matlab struct file with the same name (_sn.mat) as the original image and in the same place
4. Check log output of previous step, and give warning if FHWM value is >= 15 (possibly failed registration, but note that a value < 15 does not ensure a good registration, see case 14)
5. Create matlab .m scripts for each remaining sequence, with the following functionality
	- load and assemple the rigid transformation matrix from the elastic tranformation file
	- load the produced T2 _sn.mat struct
	- multiply the Affine transformation matric from that file with the rigid one produced before (affine * rigid - matrix multiplication)
	- saves the now modified struct as a _sn.mat file for the current sequence
6. Run the such produced matlab scripts
7. Run SPM Normalize Write / Warping for each sequence (including T2) to produce the respective image transformed to stdspace with a spacing of 1x1x1
