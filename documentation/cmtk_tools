List of interesting CMTK tools
##############################

mrbias
            This program corrects intensity inhomogeneity artifacts in MR images using a bias field estimated via entropy minimization.
sympl
            Compute the approximate symmetry plane of an image to determine, for example, the mid-sagittal plane in human brain images. Various forms of output are supported, e.g., writing the  input  image
            with the symmetry plane drawn into it, or the input image realigned along the symmetry plane.



concat_affine
            This tool computes the explicit concatenation of multiple affine coordinate transformations, each of which can be optionally inverted.
convertx
            This tool converts between image file formats and pixel data types. It can also apply simple, general-purpose image operations in the process. An arbitrary number of operations can be  specified
            on the command line, which will be applied exactly in the order given.
describe
            This tool prints a detailed description of the input image(s)
detect_spheres_matched_filter
            This tool detects spherical objects in three-dimensional images.
fit_affine_dfield
            Fit a linear affine transformation to a nonrigid transformation, either a B-spline free-form deformation or a non-parametric deformation field.

fit_affine_xform
            Fit a linear affine transformation to a list of concatenated, optionally inverted, transformations.
glm
	    Statistical modeling of pixel intensities in multiple images using a General Linear Model.
gmm
	    Segment an image into c classes using the EM algorithm for Gaussian mixtures with optional priors.
hausdorff
            This tool computes the Hausdorff distance between two label images.
mrbias
            This program corrects intensity inhomogeneity artifacts in MR images using a bias field estimated via entropy minimization.
overlap
            Compute overlap measures between two or more images
reorient
            Convert between image orientations, i.e., physically re-order pixel array and adapt stored anatomical orientation information
sympl
            Compute the approximate symmetry plane of an image to determine, for example, the mid-sagittal plane in human brain images. Various forms of output are supported, e.g., writing the  input  image
            with the symmetry plane drawn into it, or the input image realigned along the symmetry plane.
symplx
            Compute  the  approximate symmetry plane of an image to determine, for example, the mid-sagittal plane in human brain images. Various forms of output are supported, e.g., writing the input image
            with the symmetry plane drawn into it, or the input image realigned along the symmetry plane.
warp
	    This program performs nonrigid image registration using multi-resolution optimization of voxel-based image similarity measures and a multi-resolution B-spline transformation model.
warp2ps
            Write deformation field as deformed grid in PostScript format for visualization and illustration
