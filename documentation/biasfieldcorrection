Note: it seems that most tools (like imiLib and FSL) work better when the skull has been stripped before.

Note: the bias fields produced by the tools differ greatly; how to determine the best one?

Using CMTK
##########
Tested on two T2 volumes (03 + 06) with skull present.
The results are promising, with a long (20+min) runtime.

Tested on two T2 volumes (04 + 12) with skull absent.
The results are promising, with a long (20+min) runtime.

Using imiLib
############
Tested on two T2 volumes (03 + 06) with skull present.
The results are promising, with a medium runtime (~3min).

Tested on two T2 volumes (04 + 12) with skull absent.
The results are promising, with a medium runtime (~3min).

Using FSL (FAST)
