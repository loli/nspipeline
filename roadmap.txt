No smoothing of the image. It got decided to smooth the image as a pre-processing step where required but otherwise leave it as it is.

###################
Extract features from the images in t2space.
Use RFs trained on all other images (i.e. leave-one-out) to roughly detect the lesion locations.
Postprocess the results with morphological operations.
Visually check results and decide, whether some growing or shirinking of the lesion area will be required.

Implement such, that the extracted features and the trained RFs can be re-used.

Evalute segmentation results over all images, to have a statistical measure of the classifiers performance.

Extracting features:
####################
Use only a simple set of the most discriminating features. Check this using the example of 5 classifiers in the Playground.
