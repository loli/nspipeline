INFO: Done.

Remarks:
	Precision better than recall => this come from the small points, where the lesion was detected which are not connected i.e. generally lesion detected quite reliably, but always only part of it
	Generally undersegmented and (open) wholes in the segmentation
	Difficult stem mostly from insufficient skull strip, especially for upper skull plate and neck area. Damn, freesurfer also doesn't work better!

Resolutions:
	- dialation as PostProc might be required
	- (very) small elements should be removed
	- activate bigger smoother
