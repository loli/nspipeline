# pipeline
1. sequencespace: re-sample FLAIR, register others to it
2. skullstripping: where available, use T1; otherwise FLAIR
3. biasfieldcorrection: individual
4. intensityrangestd: use all sequences of one type for model and apply this model to all of this sequence type
5. features: all from all, only centerdistance from FLAIR only
6. samplesets:
    a) GT1
    b) GT2
    c) GT1 + GT2 concatenated
